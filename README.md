# Polled.io

I need a costume voting app for an annual halloween party we throw because people cheat and stuff the paper ballots.

## Getting started

Theres a python application that acts as the backend (probably complete overkill for this) and a react razzle application

### python
```
pip install -r requirements/development.txt
python api.app.py # runs on port 4000
```

### react
```
cd frontend
npm start # runs on port 3000
```
